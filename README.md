**Jack the Reader** -- or **jack**, for short -- is a framework for building an testing models on a variety of tasks that require *reading comprehension*.

To get started, please see [How to Install and Run][install] and then you may
want to have a look at the [notebooks][notebooks].  Lastly, for a high-level explanation of the ideas and
vision, see [Understanding Jack the Reader][understanding].

# Quickstart Examples - Training and Usage of a Question Answering System

To illustrate how jack works, we will show how to train a question answering
model.

### Extractive Question Answering on SQuAD

First, download SQuAD and GloVe embeddings:

```bash
$ data/SQuAD/download.sh
$ data/GloVe/download.sh
$ # Although we support native glove format it is recommended to use a memory mapped format which allows to load embeddings only as needed.
$ python3 ./bin/mmap-cli.py data/GloVe/glove.840B.300d.txt data/GloVe/glove.840B.300d.memory_map_dir 
```

Train a [FastQA][fastqa] model:

```bash
$ python3 bin/jack-train.py with train='data/SQuAD/train-v1.1.json' dev='data/SQuAD/dev-v1.1.json' reader='fastqa_reader' \
> repr_dim=300 dropout=0.5 batch_size=64 seed=1337 loader='squad' save_dir='./fastqa_reader' epochs=20 \
> with_char_embeddings=True embedding_format='memory_map_dir' embedding_file='data/GloVe/glove.840B.300d.memory_map_dir' vocab_from_embeddings=True
```

or shorter, using our prepared config:

```bash
$ python3 bin/jack-train.py with config='./conf/qa/fastqa.yaml'
```

Note, you can add a flag `tensorboard_folder=.tb/fastqa` to write arbitrary tensorboard
[summaries][tf_summaries] to a provided path (here `.tb/fastqa`). Your summaries are automatically
fetched in the train loop, so all you need to do is write them in your TF model code.

A copy of the model is written into the `save_dir` directory after each
training epoch when performance improves. These can be loaded using the commands below or see e.g.
[the showcase notebook][showcase].

You want to train another model? No problem, we have a fairly modular QAModel implementation which allows you to stick
together your own model. There are examples in `conf/qa/` (e.g., `bidaf.yaml` or our own creation `jack_qa.yaml`).
**We recommend using one of our own creations `jack_qa*.yaml` which are both fast while achieving very good
results.** These models are defined solely in the configs, i.e., there is not implementation in code.
This is possible through our `ModularQAModel`.
For more information on extractive question answering please have a look [here](/docs/Extractive_QA.md).

If all of that is too cumbersome for you and you just want to play, why not downloading a pretrained model:

```bash
$ # we still need GloVe in memory mapped format, ignore the next 2 commands if already downloaded and transformed
$ data/GloVe/download.sh
$ python3 ./bin/mmap-cli.py data/GloVe/glove.840B.300d.txt data/GloVe/glove.840B.300d.memory_map_dir 
$ wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/qb796uljoqj0lvo/fastqa.zip?dl=1
$ unzip fastqa.zip && mv fastqa fastqa_reader
```

```python
from jack import readers
from jack.core import QASetting

fastqa_reader = readers.reader_from_file("./fastqa_reader")

support = """"It is a replica of the grotto at Lourdes, 
France where the Virgin Mary reputedly appeared to Saint Bernadette Soubirous in 1858. 
At the end of the main drive (and in a direct line that connects through 3 statues and the Gold Dome), 
is a simple, modern stone statue of Mary."""

answers = fastqa_reader([QASetting(
    question="To whom did the Virgin Mary allegedly appear in 1858 in Lourdes France?",
    support=[support]
)])
```

### Recognizing Textual Entailment on SNLI

First, download SNLI

```bash
$ # we still need GloVe in memory mapped format, ignore the next 2 commands if already downloaded and transformed
$ data/GloVe/download.sh
$ python3 ./bin/mmap-cli.py data/GloVe/glove.840B.300d.txt data/GloVe/glove.840B.300d.memory_map_dir 
$ ./data/SNLI/download.sh
```

Then, for instance, train a [Decomposable Attention Model][dam]

```bash
$ python3 bin/jack-train.py with reader='dam_snli_reader' loader=snli train='data/SNLI/snli_1.0/snli_1.0_train.jsonl' \
> dev='data/SNLI/snli_1.0/snli_1.0_dev.jsonl' test='data/SNLI/snli_1.0/snli_1.0_test.jsonl' \
> save_dir='./dam_reader' repr_dim=300 epochs=20 seed=1337 dropout=0.5 batch_size=64 \
> embedding_format='memory_map_dir' embedding_file='data/GloVe/glove.840B.300d.memory_map_dir' vocab_from_embeddings=True
```

or the short version:

```bash
$ python3 bin/jack-train.py with config='./conf/snli/dam.yaml'
```

Note, you can easily change the model to one of the other implemented NLI readers. Just checkout our configurations in
`conf/snli/`. You will find for instance an `ESIM` reader (`esim.yaml`) which is realized using our `ModularNLIReader`, 
similar to question answering. You can quickly stick together your own model in a config like that. Available modules
can be found [here](/docs/Encoder_Modules.md).

Note, you can add a flag `tensorboard_folder=.tb/dam_reader` to write tensorboard
summaries to a provided path (here `.tb/dam_reader`).

A copy of the model is written into the `save_dir` directory after each
training epoch when performance improves. These can be loaded using the commands below or see e.g.
[the showcase notebook][showcase].

```python
from jack import readers
from jack.core import QASetting

dam_reader = readers.reader_from_file("./dam_reader")

answers = dam_reader([QASetting(
    question="The boy plays with the ball.",  # Hypothesis
    support=["The boy plays with the ball."]  # Premise
)])
```

# Developer guidelines

- [Comply with the PEP 8 Style Guide][pep8]
- Make sure all your code runs from the top level directory, e.g.:

```shell
$ pwd
/home/pasquale/workspace/jack
$ python3 bin/jack-train.py [..]
```
